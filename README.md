Final project for FRI: Autonomous Intelligent Robots, Spring 2015.

An attempt to allow our robot to learn to solve a simple maze using reinforcement learning techniques. The project is split into 3 independent parts:

1. Implement the SARSA algorithm in a simple grid world maze with a discrete state space.
2. Implement SARSA(λ) in a continuous state space maze using the ROS turtle simulator.
3. Implement SARSA(λ) on the physical robot with a real maze.
